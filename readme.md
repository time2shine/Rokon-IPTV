## ⚙️ Installation & Usage
 
1. **Clone the repository:**
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/time2shine/IPTV.git
cd IPTV
```
 
2. **Install Python dependencies:**
 
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml playwright pytz yt_dlp
playwright install chromium
```
 
3. **Install FFmpeg** (required for stream processing):
 
#### Linux / macOS
 
```bash
# Download and extract FFmpeg
wget -q https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-linux64-gpl.tar.xz -O ffmpeg.tar.xz
tar -xf ffmpeg.tar.xz
FFMPEG_DIR=$(ls -d ffmpeg-master-*)
# Copy binaries to system path (requires sudo)
sudo cp "$FFMPEG_DIR/bin/ffmpeg" /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp "$FFMPEG_DIR/bin/ffprobe" /usr/local/bin/
ffmpeg -version
```
 
> If you don’t have `sudo` access, extract FFmpeg to a local folder and add it to your PATH:
 
```bash
export PATH="$PWD/$FFMPEG_DIR/bin:$PATH"
```
 
#### Windows
 
1. Download a static build from [FFmpeg Builds](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
2. Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`).
3. Add the `bin` folder to your system PATH or PyCharm terminal PATH.
4. Verify installation:
 
```powershell
ffmpeg -version
```
 
> FFmpeg will now work in terminals and Python scripts (`subprocess` or `ffmpeg-python`).
 
4. **Find outputs:**
 
* `combined.m3u` → your IPTV playlist
* `epg.xml` → your TV guide
